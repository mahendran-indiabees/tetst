I’d like to share my feedback regarding the interview with [Candidate Name] for the [Position Name] role conducted on [Date].

Technical Assessment:
The candidate struggled to answer basic DevOps questions and demonstrated limited understanding of core concepts.

Responses were often irrelevant to the questions asked, indicating a gap in foundational knowledge.

When given a basic scripting task, the candidate was unable to proceed due to technical difficulties (screen sharing issues).

Communication & Preparedness:
The candidate’s communication skills need improvement, as they had difficulty articulating their thoughts clearly.

Technical issues disrupted the interview (video/screen sharing problems). While these were eventually resolved, such challenges should ideally be addressed before the interview begins to ensure a smooth process.

Recommendation:
Given the performance in both technical and communication areas, I do not recommend proceeding with this candidate for the [Position Name] role. Additionally, for future interviews, it may be helpful to:

Pre-interview Tech Check: Ensure candidates test their setup (video, audio, screen sharing) in advance.

Clear Expectations: Emphasize the importance of being technically prepared for a DevOps-focused interview.

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further.
